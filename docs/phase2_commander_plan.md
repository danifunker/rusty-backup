# Phase 2: the Commander pilot, slice by slice

Working plan for Phase 2 of [native_frontends_plan.md](native_frontends_plan.md).
Read [CONTRIBUTING.md § Architecture policy (MVC)](../CONTRIBUTING.md#architecture-policy-mvc--read-before-adding-any-code)
first; it is binding. Each slice is one or more commits on `native-frontends`,
each green (tests, `scripts/check-boundaries.sh`, the GUI build).

## Where it starts

- `src/gui/commander/pane.rs` (~4.1k lines): `CommanderPane`, one pane. Almost all
  of it is controller state and orchestration interleaved with egui drawing
  (`show()`, `source_bar`, `render_rows`).
- `src/gui/commander/mod.rs` (~1.7k): `CommanderMode`, the two-pane screen: copy,
  export, checksums, detail window, host conflicts, rename notice, session log.
- The TUI has its own thinner Commander in `src/cli/verbs/tui_app.rs`: `CmdPane`
  (~1971), `CommanderState` (~2121), `handle_commander_key` (~7377),
  `draw_commander*` (~9947-10225). It writes immediately (no staging queue) and has
  no unlock, preflight, backup / partclone sources or wrapper tree.
- The egui Commander had no keyboard shortcuts at all (slice 2 added them).

## Decisions

- The TUI Commander stages edits and applies them, like the GUI.
- Shortcuts come from `src/controller/keys.rs` (done): F1 help, F2 rename, F3 /
  Primary+I info, F5 refresh, F6 copy, F7 edit, F8 / Delete (Mac Delete/Backspace)
  delete, Primary+N new folder, F10 apply, Tab, Enter, Backspace (Mac Cmd+Up)
  parent, Space / Insert mark, Esc close; user overrides in `keybindings.toml`.
- No cross-volume move.
- Text prompts (rename, new folder, connect) are `Effect::AskText` carrying a
  controller-defined validator; the view runs it for inline feedback, the
  controller re-checks on submit. The unlock password is `AskPassword` (or the
  controller's `needs_password()` state, drawn inline by the GUI).
- After Commander, generalise `CommanderPaneController` into one browser-pane
  controller configured by a profile, used by the Commander panes, the Inspect
  browse view and the TUI explorer.

## Field classification (from the survey)

`CommanderPane` (pane.rs ~165-289), controller state: side, source, partitions,
resolved_backup, selected_part, listing, session, browser, remote, archive_source,
optical_source, optical_choices, cache_store, volume_label, fs_type, total_size,
used_size, queue, pending_open / apply / preflight / scan / wrapper / remote,
open_phase, apply_review, apply_report, reopen_restore, error, needs_password,
password_input, pending_switch, pending_host_delete, rename_dialog,
new_folder_dialog, connect_dialog, show_edits_popup, log_events, wrapper_tree,
tree_selected, tree_anchor, last_cwd, recent. View-only: nothing but egui's own
memory; `tree_index` is a cache the controller rebuilds; `open_rate` becomes a job
snapshot.

`CommanderMode` (mod.rs ~138-193), controller state: left, right, status, temp,
unsaved_close, pending_host_copy, pending_host_conflict, rename_notice,
pending_stage_copy, checksums, detail (minus the egui editors), keep_dates,
export_fork_mode, export_format, active, session_log. View: progress_window
widget, show_log, the metadata editor widgets.

## Slices

| # | Slice | Status |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | `controller::commander` skeleton: `CommanderPaneController` owns listing, queue, wrapper tree; display rows move there | done (b940c5f8) |
| - | Rename `vm` -> `controller`; key map (`controller::keys`) | done (d2ab1e1e, 6aecd207) |
| 2 | Navigation, selection and cursor as `CommanderPaneAction`s (`Enter`, `Up`, `NavigateTo`, `Click{ctrl,shift}`, `TreeClick`, `ToggleMark`, `SortBy`, cursor moves, `ActivateCursor`); collapse wrappers on cwd change inside the controller; the egui pane dispatches actions; egui keyboard through `KeyMap` | done (dc13fc05) |
| 3 | Sources as jobs: open image / host / backup / archive / optical, partition select, partclone scan, unlock; `Confirm` / `Pick*` answered by a per-view `gui::effects::EffectHost` | done (ad0950b4, 49fdb34b) |
| 4 | Queue, preflight, apply, report, reopen, wrappers; host delete / rename / mkdir as jobs; `AskText` with validators | done (52b691de, eddb9dee) |
| 5 | Remote (cfg `remote`): connect, open / close image, remote apply | done (1718ee44) |
| 6 | `CommanderController`: both panes, active side, copy, export, checksums, detail data, conflicts, rename notice, session log, unsaved close (`Effect::CloseScreen`) | done (4b807866, 665f7573) |
| 7 | Full key map wired in egui (help overlay listing the bindings) | covered by slices 2 + 6 |
| 8 | TUI Commander rebuilt on the controllers (8a open / navigate / copy, 8b queue / apply / unlock / wrappers); delete `CmdPane` / `CommanderState` | |
| 9 | Enforce the boundary for `src/gui/commander` and the TUI Commander in `scripts/check-boundaries.sh` | |
| 10 | One browser-pane controller with profiles; Inspect browse view and TUI explorer move onto it | |

Slice 3 notes, for the slices that follow:

- Effects that answer back go through the asking controller's view: each egui
  Commander pane owns an `EffectHost` and turns its `Reply`s into that pane's
  `Picked` / `Confirmed`. `gui::run_effects` stays for `AppController`, which
  asks nothing. Pickers are still blocking rfd dialogs on the UI thread.
- An open job holds its path as a `Resource` only while it runs. A new open
  abandons the running one (cancel) and, if they share a path, waits for it to
  let go; another job holding the path fails the open with "in use by".
- Transitional: `install_remote` plus `PaneRequest::SourceReset` (slice 5 moves
  remote in).

Slice 4 notes:

- `TextSpec.validator` is `fn(&TextSpec, &str) -> Result<(), String>`; its context
  (taken names, refused characters, case folding, the "unchanged" value) is data
  in the spec. An empty error disables OK silently. The controller re-runs it on
  `Answered`, then the filesystem's `validate_name`, and re-asks with the error
  (the rejected text pre-filled) on a refusal.
- Edit state lives in `controller/commander/pane/edits.rs`. A source change drops
  in-flight edit work (`EditState::reset`); a partition reopen keeps the report.
- Messages from navigation helpers (wrapper expansion) go through the
  controller's `out` buffer, returned by the next `apply` / `tick`.
- Transitional for slice 5: `set_remote_source` (wrapper extraction and copy
  from a remote image) and `report_apply_failure` (the GUI's remote apply);
  the GUI keeps `spawn_remote_apply` and its `ApplyStatus` progress.
- For slice 6: `stage_edits` / `unstage_since` are still methods the two-pane
  copy calls, and the Close guard clears `queue` directly.
- Behaviour changes: Discard asks first; the edits list can remove one edit;
  New Folder and Rename are refused on an archive pane; a taken name is
  refused in the prompt (it used to fail at Apply).

Slice 5 notes:

- Remote state lives in `controller/commander/pane/remote.rs`. The `RemoteBrowser`
  moves into each connect / open / close job and comes back with the listing, so the
  pane holds it only between jobs; `opening()` / `is_opening()` cover those jobs.
  Job keys are `rb://host:port/` (connect, close) and `rb://host:port/path` (open,
  apply).
- Actions are unconditional; without the `remote` feature `Connect`,
  `OpenRemoteImage` and `CloseRemoteImage` report "remote browsing is not built in."
- Remote apply is the local flow with a different target (`ApplyTarget` in
  `edits.rs`): `preflight_remote_apply`, the same review, `remote_apply_in_job`.
  The daemon cannot skip, so a review's Skip drops the conflicting copies from the
  queue; Replace uploads with force. Only copies and new folders travel; delete and
  rename are refused when asked for. A failed remote apply changed nothing, keeps
  its queue and report, and is not reopened.
- `PaneRequest` is down to `ShowInfo`; `SourceReset` and `OpenImage` are gone.
  `display_rows()` takes no argument (the controller knows when it is remote).
- `gui/commander/progress.rs` stays: the host copy and stage copy still use it (gone in slice 6).
- Behaviour changes: a remote host pane no longer shows Apply / Discard / New
  Folder (staging there never worked); Delete / F8 / rename on a remote pane are
  refused up front; the connect prompt validates the port; a remote copy that hits
  an existing name now gets the review instead of failing the whole upload.
- Tests: `tests/remote_filesystem.rs` `commander_remote::*` drive the controller
  against a loopback daemon (connect, open, new folder, apply, reopen, close,
  disconnect; Skip and Replace; a refused connect).

Slice 6 notes:

- `CommanderController` (`controller/commander/screen.rs`, `screen/copy.rs`) owns both
  panes. `Pane(side, ..)` forwards; a pane's `Message`s become the status line
  (`[L] ...`), its `take_log` lines the session log, its File Info requests
  (`take_info_request`, which replaced `PaneRequest`) open the detail data. A pane's
  picker / confirm / prompt leaves as an effect and the answer is routed back to the
  pane that asked by `purpose` (`asker`); the screen's own purposes are `EXPORT` and
  `CLOSE_UNSAVED`. The egui Commander has one `EffectHost`.
- Copy, stage copy, export and checksums are jobs on the app registry
  (`commander_ops::{host_copy_in_job, stage_copy_in_job}`, `checksum::checksum_in_job`,
  all over the old runners through `worker::run_mirrored`). They hold the destination
  folder and the source image they read, so an apply on that source waits. One copy or
  export runs at a time.
- Archive wrapper mounts now carry a reopen recipe (`ReopenRecipe::ArchiveBytes` or
  by path), so the synchronous wrapper copy / export fallbacks and `export_now` are gone.
- `Key(Key, Mods)` resolves through the `KeyMap` in the controller (`binds` tells the
  view which events to hand over); the F1 help rows come from `key_help()`. That
  covers slice 7.
- File Info: the controller holds side, entry, editable, fs type, preview bytes,
  xattrs and the last result; the egui editors read the pane queue through a
  `MetadataSink` and send `StageMetadata(MetadataEdit)`; `EditQueue::stage_metadata`
  does the staging (the browse view uses the same sink on its own queue).
- Transitional: the File Info preview (up to 1 MiB) and xattrs are still read
  synchronously from the pane's open filesystem in `OpenDetail`; host-copy conflict
  detection stats the destination on the UI thread, as before.
- Behaviour changes: the checksum window shows a progress bar, then all results (not
  each file as it finishes) and gains "Copy all"; a second copy cannot start while a
  stage copy runs (before only host copies blocked it); metadata edits are refused
  while the pane applies; a copy/export from a `.sit` expanded inside an image now
  runs as a job with progress; the unsaved-close dialog is the shared confirmation.

Each slice: `cargo test` for what it touched, `tests/ui_scenarios.rs`,
`scripts/check-boundaries.sh`, the GUI build (on a machine without GTK headers,
swap `rfd` to `xdg-portal` for the check and swap it back; never commit the swap),
and the vintage proxy build from CONTRIBUTING.md § Rust 1.73 floor.
