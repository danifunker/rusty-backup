# Phase 2: the Commander pilot, slice by slice

Working plan for Phase 2 of [native_frontends_plan.md](native_frontends_plan.md).
Read [CONTRIBUTING.md § Architecture policy (MVC)](../CONTRIBUTING.md#architecture-policy-mvc--read-before-adding-any-code)
first; it is binding. Each slice is one or more commits on `native-frontends`,
each green (tests, `scripts/check-boundaries.sh`, the GUI build).

## Where it starts

- `src/gui/commander/pane.rs` (~4.1k lines): `CommanderPane`, one pane. Almost all
  of it is controller state and orchestration interleaved with egui drawing
  (`show()`, `source_bar`, `render_rows`).
- `src/gui/commander/mod.rs` (~1.7k): `CommanderMode`, the two-pane screen: copy,
  export, checksums, detail window, host conflicts, rename notice, session log.
- The TUI has its own thinner Commander in `src/cli/verbs/tui_app.rs`: `CmdPane`
  (~1971), `CommanderState` (~2121), `handle_commander_key` (~7377),
  `draw_commander*` (~9947-10225). It writes immediately (no staging queue) and has
  no unlock, preflight, backup / partclone sources or wrapper tree.
- The egui Commander has no keyboard shortcuts at all.

## Decisions

- The TUI Commander stages edits and applies them, like the GUI.
- Shortcuts come from `src/controller/keys.rs` (done): F1 help, F2 rename, F3 /
  Primary+I info, F5 refresh, F6 copy, F7 edit, F8 / Delete (Mac Delete/Backspace)
  delete, Primary+N new folder, F10 apply, Tab, Enter, Backspace (Mac Cmd+Up)
  parent, Space / Insert mark, Esc close; user overrides in `keybindings.toml`.
- No cross-volume move.
- Text prompts (rename, new folder, connect) are `Effect::AskText` carrying a
  controller-defined validator; the view runs it for inline feedback, the
  controller re-checks on submit. The unlock password is `AskPassword` (or the
  controller's `needs_password()` state, drawn inline by the GUI).
- After Commander, generalise `CommanderPaneController` into one browser-pane
  controller configured by a profile, used by the Commander panes, the Inspect
  browse view and the TUI explorer.

## Field classification (from the survey)

`CommanderPane` (pane.rs ~165-289), controller state: side, source, partitions,
resolved_backup, selected_part, listing, session, browser, remote, archive_source,
optical_source, optical_choices, cache_store, volume_label, fs_type, total_size,
used_size, queue, pending_open / apply / preflight / scan / wrapper / remote,
open_phase, apply_review, apply_report, reopen_restore, error, needs_password,
password_input, pending_switch, pending_host_delete, rename_dialog,
new_folder_dialog, connect_dialog, show_edits_popup, log_events, wrapper_tree,
tree_selected, tree_anchor, last_cwd, recent. View-only: nothing but egui's own
memory; `tree_index` is a cache the controller rebuilds; `open_rate` becomes a job
snapshot.

`CommanderMode` (mod.rs ~138-193), controller state: left, right, status, temp,
unsaved_close, pending_host_copy, pending_host_conflict, rename_notice,
pending_stage_copy, checksums, detail (minus the egui editors), keep_dates,
export_fork_mode, export_format, active, session_log. View: progress_window
widget, show_log, the metadata editor widgets.

## Slices

| # | Slice | Status |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | `controller::commander` skeleton: `CommanderPaneController` owns listing, queue, wrapper tree; display rows move there | done (b940c5f8) |
| - | Rename `vm` -> `controller`; key map (`controller::keys`) | done (d2ab1e1e, 6aecd207) |
| 2 | Navigation, selection and cursor as `CommanderPaneAction`s (`Enter`, `Up`, `NavigateTo`, `Click{ctrl,shift}`, `TreeClick`, `ToggleMark`, `SortBy`, cursor moves, `ActivateCursor`); collapse wrappers on cwd change inside the controller; the egui pane dispatches actions; egui keyboard through `KeyMap` | |
| 3 | Sources as jobs: open image / host / backup / archive / optical, partition select, partclone scan, unlock; `Confirm` / `Pick*` implemented in `gui::run_effects` | |
| 4 | Queue, preflight, apply, report, reopen, wrappers; host delete / rename / mkdir as jobs; `AskText` with validators | |
| 5 | Remote (cfg `remote`): connect, open / close image, remote apply | |
| 6 | `CommanderController`: both panes, active side, copy, export, checksums, detail data, conflicts, rename notice, session log, unsaved close (`Effect::CloseScreen`) | |
| 7 | Full key map wired in egui (help overlay listing the bindings) | |
| 8 | TUI Commander rebuilt on the controllers (8a open / navigate / copy, 8b queue / apply / unlock / wrappers); delete `CmdPane` / `CommanderState` | |
| 9 | Enforce the boundary for `src/gui/commander` and the TUI Commander in `scripts/check-boundaries.sh` | |
| 10 | One browser-pane controller with profiles; Inspect browse view and TUI explorer move onto it | |

Each slice: `cargo test` for what it touched, `tests/ui_scenarios.rs`,
`scripts/check-boundaries.sh`, the GUI build (on a machine without GTK headers,
swap `rfd` to `xdg-portal` for the check and swap it back; never commit the swap),
and the vintage proxy build from CONTRIBUTING.md § Rust 1.73 floor.
